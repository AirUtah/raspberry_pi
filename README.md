AirU Project: Raspberry Pi Communication Protocol
=====================================

# About

The AirU Project consists of multiple components. This component, the Raspberry Pi Communication Protocol, is what connects our Raspberry Pi devices to our central AirU server. This protocol is responsible for executing queries to a database local to the device, parsing the data into JSON, and shipping the JSON to the AirU server.
